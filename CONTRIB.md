All of our issues and project management are available through YouTrack, an issue tracker and project management system from JetBrains that works with PyCharm, our IDE of choice. [View project in YouTrack &rsaquo;](https://marquiskurt.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issues?q=project:%20Octodollop)

## Working with Akinom
[<img src = "https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/pycharm/files/2015/12/PyCharm_400x400_Twitter_logo_white.png" width = "100px" align = "right" />](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

This project works in PyCharm, the Python IDEA from JetBrains (the same guys behind YouTrack and IntelliJ IDEA). If you have the Toolbox app installed and the respective extension in your browser, you can click the PyCharm icon on the GitHub page to clone it using SSH.

> Looking for how to enable the project file templates? Open your PyCharm preferences and under `Editor > File and Code Templates`, change your scheme from `Default` to `Project`.
