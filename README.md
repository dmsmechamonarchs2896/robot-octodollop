# Project Octodollop
Official MechaMonarchs robot software for FRC 2018

## About this project
For the past few years, Team 2896 has used LabVIEW, a solid programming language, to code the robot. Although LabVIEW gets the job done, it isn't the most elegant solution or the most forward-thinking. Furthermore, LabVIEW's syntax and interface isn't easy to pick up.

This year, we wanted to try something different: create our robot code with Python 3 using the PyQt and the RobotPy frameworks, with the latter being specifically designed for FRC robotics. This repository holds our source code, licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

## PyCharm

This project works in PyCharm, the Python IDEA from JetBrains (the same guys behind YouTrack and IntelliJ IDEA). If you have the Toolbox app installed and the respective extension in your browser, you can click the PyCharm icon on the GitHub page to clone it using SSH.
