**Codename Octodollop**

Official MechaMonarchs robot software for FRC 2018

## About this project
For the past few years, Team 2896 has used LabVIEW, a solid programming language, to code the robot. Although LabVIEW gets the job done, it isn't the most elegant solution or the most forward-thinking. Furthermore, LabVIEW's syntax and interface isn't easy to pick up.

This year, we wanted to try something different: create our robot code with Python 3 using the PyQt and the RobotPy frameworks, with the latter being specifically designed for FRC robotics. This repository holds our source code, licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

A LabVIEW-compatible version is available in the `robot-octodollop-labview` repository. [View code &rsaquo;](http://www.github.com/dmsmechamonarchs2896/robot-octodollop-labview)
